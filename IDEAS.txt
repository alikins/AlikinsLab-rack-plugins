- WidgetStorm
 - a big a** module with examples of many many different
   widgets
 - mostly as demo / test
 - sub sets
   - builtin nanovg/oui/blendish
   - rack provided unrestricted
   - rack provided with restricted artwork (components.hpp)
   - various interesting widgets reused from other open
     source plugins
  - maybe actually hook them up to outputs if someone wants
    a weird controller
- Vertigo
  - like CableMadness, but modulate the zoom level
  - 84% evil
- Unnamed Module To Control Rack Scroll/Pan
  - modulate the main rack view scroll bars
  - 91% evil
- Cable Madness 2: The Notch Uppening
 - dig into rack scene/widget and tweak individual
   wire widgets
 - guess you could change the color, not sure what else
 - could maybe set custom colors beyond the 4 enumerated
   standard colors?
   - would need to change the nvg context and not the
     color enum for to_json/from_json to work?
- Cable Madness 3D: At Worlds End
  - add random cables?
  - JW Cat can disconnect, guess we could add/connect
    as well? maybe?
  - Take 'Randomize' up from Chaotic Good to Chaotic Evil
- Preset browser?
  - browsable list of all plugin presets
  - like module browser but for presets?
  - kind of abusing module interface
  - (suspect Rack will get a builtin version so
     likely unneeded as a module)
